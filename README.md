## What is Cobalt?
Cobalt is a security-focused desktop operating system with a focus on security, minimalism and compatibility.

If you are not willing to commit to using Cobalt, you can opt for [Cobalt Linux](https://github.com/cobaltbsd/cobalt-linux), a micro-distribution of Linux built on Cobalt's ecosystem.

More detailed information about Cobalt can be found at [CobaltBSD.github,io](https://cobaltbsd.github.io).

This repository contains the build scripts and kernel.

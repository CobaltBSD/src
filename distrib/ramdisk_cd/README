HOW TO INSTALL (More in-depth instructions to come)

Cobalt does not as of yet have an automatic installer. This environment is capable of installing a tiny environment which is suitable for building the rest of Cobalt.

## Creating the proper disk layout
1. Find the disk you wish to install to. Typically it will either be sd# (SCSI) or wd# (IDE). Use `disklabel sd0` or similar to print out the layout of a given disk.

2. Create the disk structure using `fdisk`.
FOR MBR: `# fdisk -iy <diskname>`
FOR GPT: `# fdisk -gy -b 532480 <diskname>`

3. Create your partition layout. In this example, a single partition will be created for the entire system. This is usually unrecommended. Also note that on OpenBSD, you can skip this step and use the entire disk as a partition. This is unrecommended and will only work for external storage devices, as it won't leave room for the bootloader.
`# disklabel -E <diskname>`
`diskname> a a`
`offset: <Enter>`
`size: *`
`FS type: <Enter>`
`diskname*> w`
`diskname> q`

4. Format the disk:
`# newfs <partname>` (e.g. `# newfs sd0a`)

5. Install the bootloader:
`# mount /dev/<partname> /mnt`
`# installboot -r /mnt <diskname> /usr/mdec/biosboot /usr/mdec/boot` (for MBR, amd64)

6. Install the basic environment:
At the moment, this is most easily done by copying or creating the following root directories, plus decompressing the full kernel:
`# gunzip -c /bsd.gz > /mnt/bsd`
`# cp -frp /bin /sbin /usr /etc /var /mnt`
`# mkdir /mnt/{dev,tmp,mnt,root}`
`# cp -v /dev/MAKEDEV /mnt/dev`
`# cd /mnt/dev`
`# sh MAKEDEV std sd0 wd0 cd0`
`# cd /`
`# umount /mnt`

At this point, remove the install medium and reboot.

7. Install the full environment:
You will need to obtain a tarball of the Cobalt source tree, plus Xenocara if desired. In the minimal Cobalt environment, extract these and begin the build process. You will also need the following files present:
/opt/tools/bin/clang
/opt/tools/bin/ld.lld
/opt/tools/bin/ld
/opt/tools/bin/omake
/opt/tools/lib/libc++.so.9.0
/opt/tools/lib/libc++abi.so.6.0
/opt/tools/share/omk
These are included in tools.tar.gz

This document is a rough outline. More to come soon.

CobaltBSD/MACHINE OSREV should work on all machines using the amd64
architecture. Support for other architectures is being considered but
not currently implemented.

CobaltBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports most SMP (Symmetrical MultiProcessor)
systems.  To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel (bsd.mp)
is included with the installation.

CobaltBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports both UEFI/GPT booting and BIOS/MBR
booting.

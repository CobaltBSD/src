Warning! Upgrades to CobaltBSD OSREV are currently only supported from the
immediately previous release.  The upgrade process will also work with older
releases, but might not execute some migration tasks that would be necessary
for a proper upgrade.

The best solution, whenever possible, is to backup your data and reinstall
from scratch.

To upgrade CobaltBSD OSREV from a previous version, start with the general
instructions in the section "Installing CobaltBSD".

Boot from the CD-ROM as you would do for a new installation.
When prompted, select the (U)pgrade option rather than the (I)nstall
option at the prompt in the install process.

You will be presented with a welcome message, and depending on how you are
connected to the system, you will be asked to set the terminal type or to
choose a keyboard layout.

The upgrade script will ask you for the existing root partition, and
will use the existing filesystems defined in /etc/fstab to install the
new system in.  It will also use your existing network parameters.

From then, the upgrade procedure is very close to the installation
procedure described earlier in this document.

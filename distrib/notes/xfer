Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	DOS (FAT) partitions (NOT supported if booting from floppy)
	EXT2 partitions (NOT supported if booting from floppy)
	Remote NFS partition (NOT supported if booting from floppy)
	HTTP

If you can't (or don't want to) boot off a CD-ROM, you can use a USB
key.  Failing that, if your computer supports PXE, you can prepare a
server to start the install across the network.

Creating a PXE network bootable setup using CobaltBSD or other Unix-like system:

	In order to start the install via PXE, you will need to set up a
	DHCP server and a TFTP server.  The details of how to do this
	vary considerably, depending on the network's host.  You should
	refer to the relevant man pages or administrator's guide for the
	host system.

	The DHCP server should return "pxeboot" to MACHINE clients as the
	network boot program.  Both pxeboot and the bsd.rd install kernel
	should be copied to the TFTP server's root directory.

	If you are using a CobaltBSD server, you can use the supplied dhcpd
	and tftpd.  A sample configuration for dhcpd is given in the
	pxeboot(8) man page. You should also refer to dhcpd(8) and tftpd(8)
	for more information on configuring them.

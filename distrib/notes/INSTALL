INSTALLATION NOTES for CobaltBSD/MACHINE OSREV


What is CobaltBSD?
----------------

CobaltBSD is a fully functional UN*X-like Operating System based
primarily on OpenBSD. CobaltBSD focuses on exporting what OpenBSD and
other BSDs have to offer to a more robust desktop experience. Like
OpenBSD, CobaltBSD focuses on a "secure-by-default," meaning you can
be sure that a freshly installed machine will be free of security
holes.

CobaltBSD's development prioritizes stability and security over new
features and bleeding-edge. Components are updated conservatively,
typically to enhance stability or security rather than to implement
new features. As a result, CobaltBSD provides a desktop which can
easily outlive Linux or other BSDs in terms of uptime.

As part of this model, CobaltBSD is extremely tiny relative to other
desktop operating systems. The system can be fully compiled with
TinyCC and is free from corporate influence as well as the typical
monoliths such as LLVM or GNU which affect other desktops. C is the
sole systems language in use by CobaltBSD.

Cobalt is a fully free, source-compiled operating system.

dnl MACHINE/whatis
dnl A few descriptive words about the port to MACHINE (i.e. what kind
dnl of hardware it runs on, without too much details - MACHINE/hardware
dnl will take care of this).

Using online CobaltBSD documentation:
-----------------------------------

Extensive documentation is available on the base system.
Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation) are denoted by
"name(section)".  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1),
	passwd(5) and
	afterboot(8).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The "man" command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering "man [section] topic".  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.

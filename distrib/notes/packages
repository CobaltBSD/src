As complete as your CobaltBSD system is, you may want to add any of several
excellent third party software applications.  There are two ways to
do this. You can:

1) Use the CobaltBSD ports collection to automatically get any
   needed source file, apply any required patches, create the
   application, and install it for you.

2) Obtain the source code and build the application based
   upon whatever installation procedures are provided with the
   application.

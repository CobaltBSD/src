There are several ways to install CobaltBSD onto a disk.  The easiest
way, should your computer support it, is to boot off the CobaltBSD
CD-ROM, USB key, or off one of the bootable CD-ROM mini images. If
your machine supports PXE network boots, you could try to configure a
server for a network install.

	If you are using CD-ROM or USB key, ensure the media is
	present before starting.

	Reboot the computer to begin the install.  You might have to play
	with your BIOS options to get the computer to boot from the
	correct installation media (CD, USB key or network/PXE)	rather
	than from the hard disk.

	If you are installing across the network with PXE, you will need
	to tell pxeboot to get the bsd.rd install kernel:

	    boot> boot bsd.rd

	It can take a while to load the kernel from a slow speed CD-ROM
	drive, or across a network; most likely more than a minute. If some
	action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor has stopped
	and nothing further has happened, either your boot media is bad or
	you are having hardware problems. If trying another floppy disk
	doesn't help, CobaltBSD probably can't be run on your hardware. This
	can probably be considered a bug, so you might want to report it.
	If you do, please {:-include-:} as many details about your system
	configuration as you can.

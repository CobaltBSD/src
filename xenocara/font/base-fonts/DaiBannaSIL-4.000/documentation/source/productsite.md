<h2 id="about">About</h2>

Dai Banna SIL is a Unicode font package for rendering New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters. It includes a complete set of New Tai Lue consonants, vowels, tones, and digits, along with punctuation and other useful symbols. Apart from a few New Tai Lue characters and Chinese punctuation marks, the design is the same as its predecessor, SIL Dai Banna (obsolete).

For a different style of New Tai Lue script, see SILâ€™s [Nokyung](https://software.sil.org/nokyung) fonts.

The New Tai Lue script is used by approximately 300,000 people who speak the Xishuangbanna Dai language in Yunnan, China. It is a simplification of the Tai Tham (Old Tai Lue) script as used for this language for hundreds of years.

We particularly thank the Dai News Department of Xishuangbanna Daily for valuable advice during the development of this Unicode font package. Xishuangbanna Daily, established in 1957, is the largest newspaper company in Yunnan, China that publishes in the New Tai Lue script.

## Linebreaking Control

The Dai Banna SIL fonts have built-in Graphite smart font code to control line breaking by allowing it between syllables only. This is useful because intersyllabic space is optional in New Tai Lue text, and without space marking syllable boundaries, standard applications will just break the line whenever it is full, likely splitting up a syllable.

To correctly render a run of text with no intersyllabic space, you must be using applications and/or operating systems that provide an adequate level of support for Graphite. Tested applications which make use of the Graphite capabilities of the fonts include:

- LibreOffice Writer (cross-platform)
- GrInD (for use with InDesign)

Non-tested but possible functionality might include these applications:

- FireFox browser
- XeTeX typesetting program

More information on Graphite technology and related applications is available at [Graphite](https://graphite.sil.org/).

### Current Version

[sil_download style="table" sort="name" where="info.type == 'font'"]

### Release Notes for v4.000

The previous weights in two families (Dai Banna SIL Light and Dai Banna SIL Book) are now included in one family (Dai Banna SIL) with an additional weight (Medium).

For the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters the weights should be the same as before, just with different font names.
For example, Dai Banna SIL Light (Bold) is now Dai Banna SIL (SemiBold). Note the change in the font name and the (weight).

If there are any differences, the change in build tools (and sources) would probably be the reason.
The build process for the fonts completely changed to using open sources built using open source tools.

Most of the Latin characters have been replaced. In the previous release the Latin characters were the same weight
even if the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) characters were a different weight.
Now a different Latin font was imported (Gentium Plus) at the correct weight (such as Bold) and style (such as Italic).

Dai Banna SIL
=============

This file provides detailed information on the Dai Banna SIL fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Dai Banna SIL fonts and any derivative works.

## About this project

This project provides a free and open font family for the New Tai Lue (Xishuangbanna Dai) script.
The New Tai Lue script is used by approximately 300,000 people who speak the Xishuangbanna Dai language in Yunnan, China. It is a simplification of the Tai Tham (Old Tai Lue) script as used for this language for hundreds of years.

It uses Graphite technology to support complex script behaviours like intersyllabic line breaking in spaceless text. (NB: Only basic break opportunities are accounted for in the current release. Breaking behaviours for numbers and special CCV structures have yet to be added.)

The previous weights in two families (Dai Banna SIL Light and Dai Banna SIL Book) are now included in one family (Dai Banna SIL) with an additional weight (Medium).

The original, non-Unicode font package (SIL Dai Banna) was developed with assistance from the Research Centre for the Minority Languages of China, Institute of Ethonology and Anthropology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences located in Beijing, China.

Subsequent, Unicode releases (Dai Banna SIL) were developed with valuable input from Ms. YU Kanglong, Chief Editor, Dai News Department, Xishuangbanna Daily. Xishuangbanna Daily, established since 1957, is the largest newspaper company in Yunnan, China that publishes in the New Tai Lue script.

The Dai Banna SIL project is maintained by SIL International, a global,
faith-based nonprofit that works with local communities around the world
to develop language solutions that expand possibilities for a better life.

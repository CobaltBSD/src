                            Patch #378 - 2023/01/09

     * improve  descriptions  of  XTQMODKEYS  and  XTQALLOWED  features in
       ctlseqs.ms (reports by Bram Moolenaar, Thomas Wolff).
     * add bracketed+paste and report+version building blocks to terminfo,
       from ncurses 6.4
     * improve   check   for   unsupported  formatting  characters,  e.g.,
       zero-width space, to properly ignore them (report by Thomas Wolff).
     * improve/document  error-checking  for  some  of  the controls which
       return   responses:   DECRQSS,   XTGETXRES,   XTSETTCAP,  XTGETTCAP
       (prompted by discussion with David Leadbeater).
     * improve  limit-checks  for fallback font cache (report by Dimitrije
       Erdeljan).
     * improve check for too-wide glyph in fallback font by allowing xterm
       to  continue searching for a suitable font rather than just failing
       on  the first. Also add limitFontWidth to allow changing the amount
       by  which  a  glyph  must extend outside the font's bounding box to
       disallow it.

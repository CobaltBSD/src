.Sh NAME
.Nm XKB-Config
.Nd The XKB Configuration Guide
.Sh ABSTRACT
This document describes how to configure Xorg XKB from a user's point
of view.
It covers basic configuration syntax and gives also a few examples.
.Pp
This version covers Xorg server versions 1.8 and later, used with the
data files from the
.Lk http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig xkeyboard-config
project.
.Sh OVERVIEW
The XKB configuration is decomposed into a number of components.
Selecting
proper parts and combining them back you can achieve most of the configurations
you might need.
Unless you have a completely atypical keyboard you really don't
need to touch any of the xkb configuration files.
.Pp
Some desktop environments now provide integrated graphical configuration
tools for setting XKB configuration as part of your desktop session.
The
instructions in this document are provided for those without such support,
those who need to configure XKB before the session startup (such as at the
login screen), or those who need to perform more advanced configuration
than those tools provide.
.Sh SELECTING XKB CONFIGURATION
The easiest and the most natural way to specify a keyboard mapping is to use
the
.Ql rules
component.
As its name suggests it describes a number of
general rules to combine all bits and pieces into a valid and useful keyboard
mapping.
All you need to do is to select a suitable rules file and then to
feed it with a few parameters that will adjust the keyboard behaviour to
fulfill your needs.
.Pp
The parameters are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl XkbRules
files of rules to be used for keyboard mapping composition
.It Fl XkbModel
name of the model of your keyboard type
.It Fl XkbLayout
layout(s) you intend to use
.It Fl XkbVariant
variant(s) of the layout you intend to use
.It Fl XkbOptions
extra xkb configuration options
.El
.Pp
The rules file used depends on your system.
The rules files commonly
used with Xorg are provided by the
.Lk http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/XKeyboardConfig xkeyboard-config
project.
On Linux systems, the
.Pa evdev
rules are most
commonly used, on other systems the
.Pa base
rules
are used.
Some additional rules files exist for historical reasons,
but are no longer widely used.
In general, it's best to simply not
specify the rules file, in order to use the default rules selected
automatically by the X server.
.Pp
For each rules file there is a description file named
.Pa < Ns Ar vendor-rules Ns > . Ns lst ,
for instance
.Pa base.lst
which is located in
the xkb configuration subdirectory
.Pa rules
(for example
.Pa /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules ) .
.Ss Basic Configuration
Let's say you want to configure a PC-style American keyboard with 104
keys as described in
.Pa base.lst .
This can be done
by simply writing several lines from below to a new configuration file
in
.Pa /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d ,
such
as
.Pa /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-custom-kbd.conf .
.Bd -literal
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "keyboard defaults"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XkbModel" "pc104"
    Option "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option "XKbOptions" ""
EndSection
.Ed
.Pp
The values of
.Fl XkbModel
and
.Fl XkbLayout
are
really not surprising.
The
.Fl XkbOptions
has been explicitly set to the empty set of parameters.
The
.Fl XkbVariant
option has been left out.
That means the default variant named
.Ql basic
is loaded.
.Pp
Of course, this can be also done at runtime using the utility
.Nm setxkbmap .
The shell command loading the same keyboard mapping would look like:
.Bd -literal
setxkbmap -model pc104 -layout us -option ""
.Ed
.Pp
The configuration and the shell command would be very analogous
for most other layouts (internationalized mappings).
.Pp
If you wanted to enable the
.Sy Ctrl
.Sy Alt Ns Sy Backspace
sequence to kill
the X server by default, you could create a configuration snippet
.Pa /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/90-zap.conf
containing:
.Bd -literal
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "keyboard defaults"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XKbOptions" "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
EndSection
.Ed
.Pp
This would be equivalent to running the shell command:
.Bd -literal
setxkbmap -option "terminate:ctrl_alt_bksp"
.Ed
.Ss Advanced Configuration
You can use multi-layouts xkb configuration.
What does it mean?
Basically it allows to load up to four different
keyboard layouts at a time.
Each such layout would reside in its
own group.
The groups (unlike complete keyboard remapping) can be
switched very fast from one to another by a combination of keys.
.Pp
Let's say you want to configure your new Logitech cordless desktop
keyboard, you intend to use three different layouts at the same
time - us, czech and german (in this order), and that you are used to
.Sy Alt Ns Sy Shift
combination for switching among them.
.Pp
Then the configuration snippet could look like this:
.Bd -literal
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "Logitech Cordless"
    MatchIsKeyboard   "on"
    Option "XkbModel" "logicordless"
    Option "XkbLayout" "us,cz,de"
    Option "XKbOptions" "grp:alt_shift_toggle"
EndSection
.Ed
.Pp
Of course, this can be also done at runtime using the utility
.Nm setxkbmap .
The shell command loading the same keyboard mapping would look like:
.Bd -literal
setxkbmap -model logicordless -layout "us,cz,de" \e
         -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle"
.Ed
.Ss Even More Advanced Configuration
Okay, let's say you are more demanding.
You do like the example
above but you want it to change a bit.
Let's imagine you want
the czech keyboard mapping to use another variant but basic.
The configuration snippet then changes into:
.Bd -literal
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "Logitech Cordless"
    MatchIsKeyboard   "on"
    Option "XkbModel" "logicordless"
    Option "XkbLayout" "us,cz,de"
    Option "XkbVariant" ",bksl,"
    Option "XKbOptions" "grp:alt_shift_toggle" EndSection
.Ed
.Pp
That seems tricky but it is not.
The logic for settings of variants
is the same as for layouts, that means the first and the third variant
settings are left out (set to
.Ql basic ) ,
the second is set to
.Ql bksl
(a special
variant with an enhanced definition of the backslash key).
.Pp
Analogously, the loading runtime will change to:
.Bd -literal
setxkbmap -model logicordless -layout "us,cz,de" \e
         -variant ",bksl," -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle"
.Ed
.Ss Basic Global Options
For a list of available options, with a short description of what they do,
see the section starting with
.Dq Li ! option
in the
.Pa rules/*.lst
files.
.Sh KEYMAP XKB CONFIGURATION
Keymap configuration is the way formerly used to configure xkb.
The
user included a special keymap file which specified the direct xkb
configuration.
This method has been obsoleted by previously described
rules files which are far more flexible and allow simpler and more
intuitive syntax.
It is preserved merely for compatibility reasons and
should be avoided if possible.

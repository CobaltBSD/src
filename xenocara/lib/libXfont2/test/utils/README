This directory contains utilities which can be used for adhoc testing of
libXfont by developers, and which are hoped to be useful for building up
automated testing in the future.

They are not intended for distros to package and ship to end users - they
are not documented, and are full of assert() and fatal err() calls where
end user software would have error handling.

No promises of interface stability are made for these - they may change at
any time to allow better testing.

Utilities include:

lsfontdir:
    Reads & prints the contents of fonts.dir files.
    Takes a list of font path entries on the command line, uses defaults
    if none specified.
    For use with afl fuzzer, you must use afl -f fonts.dir lsfontdir @@

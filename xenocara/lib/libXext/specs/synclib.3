.Nd X Synchronization Extension Library
.Sh SYNCHRONIZATION PROTOCOL
The core X protocol makes no guarantees about the relative order of
execution of requests for different clients.
This means that any
synchronization between clients must be done at the client level in an
operating system-dependent and network-dependent manner.
Even if there
was an accepted standard for such synchronization, the use of a network
introduces unpredictable delays between the synchronization of the clients and
the delivery of the resulting requests to the X server.
.Pp
The core X protocol also makes no guarantees about the time at which
requests are executed, which means that all clients with real-time constraints
must implement their timing on the host computer.
Any such timings are
subject to error introduced by delays within the operating system and
network and are ineﬃcient because of the need for round-trip requests that
keep the client and server synchronized.
.Pp
The synchronization extension provides primitives that allow synchronization
between clients to take place entirely within the X server.
This removes any
error introduced by the network and makes it possible to synchronize clients
on different hosts running different operating systems.
This is important for
multimedia applications, where audio, video, and graphics data streams are
being synchronized.
The extension also provides internal timers within the X
server to which client requests can be synchronized.
This allows simple
animation applications to be implemented without any round-trip requests
and makes best use of buffering within the client, network, and server.
.Ss Description
The mechanism used by this extension for synchronization within the X server
is to block the processing of requests from a client until a specific
synchronization condition occurs.
When the condition occurs, the client is
released and processing of requests continues.
Multiple clients may block on
the same condition to give inter-client synchronization.
Alternatively, a single
client may block on a condition such as an animation frame marker.
.Pp
The extension adds
.Fn Counter
and
.Fn Alarm
to the set of resources managed by
the server.
A counter has a 64-bit integer value that may be increased or
decreased by client requests or by the server internally.
A client can
block by sending an
.Fn Await
request that waits until
one of a set of synchronization conditions, called TRIGGERs, becomes TRUE.
.Pp
The
.Fn CreateCounter
request allows a client to create
a
.Fn Counter
that can be changed by explicit
.Fn SetCounter
and
.Fn ChangeCounter
requests.
These can be used to implement synchronization between
different clients.
.Pp
There are some counters, called
.Fn System Counters ,
that are changed by the server internally rather than by client
requests.
The effect of any change to a system counter is not visible
until the server has finished processing the current request.
In other
words, system counters are apparently updated in the gaps between the
execution of requests rather than during the actual execution of a
request.
The extension provides a system counter that advances with the
server time as defined by the core protocol, and it may also provide
counters that advance with the real-world time or that change each
time the CRT screen is refreshed.
Other extensions may provide their own
extension-specific system counters.
.Pp
The extension provides an
.Fn Alarm
mechanism that allows clients to receive an
event on a regular basis when a particular counter is changed.
.Sh C LANGUAGE BINDING
The C routines provide direct access to the protocol and add no additional
semantics.
.Pp
The include file for this extension is <X11/extensions/sync.h>.
Most of the names in the language binding are derived from the protocol
names by prepending XSync to the protocol name and changing the
capitalization.
.Ss C Functions
Most of the following functions generate SYNC protocol requests.
.Pp
.Ft Status
.Fo XSyncQueryExtension
.Fa "Display *dpy"
.Fa "int *event_base_return"
.Fa "int *error_base_return"
.Fc
.Pp
If dpy supports the SYNC extension,
.Fn XSyncQueryExtension
returns True,
sets *event_base_return to the event number for the first SYNC event, and
sets *error_base_return to the error number for the first SYNC error.
If dpy
does not support the SYNC extension, it returns False.
.Pp
.Ft Status
.Fo XSyncInitialize
.Fa "Display *dpy"
.Fa "int *major_version_return"
.Fa "int *minor_version_return"
.Fc
.Pp
.Fn XSyncInitialize
sets *major_version_return and
*minor version return to the major/minor SYNC protocol version supported
by the server.
If the XSync library is compatible with the version
returned by the server, this function returns
.Fn True .
If dpy does not support the SYNC extension, or if there was an error
during communication with the server, or if the server and library protocol
versions are incompatible, this function returns
.Fn False .
The only XSync function that may be called before this function is
XSyncQueryExtension.
If a client violates this rule, the effects of all XSync
calls that it makes are undefined.
.Pp
.Ft XSyncSystemCounter
.Fo "* XSyncListSystemCounters"
.Fa "Display *dpy"
.Fa "int *n_counters_return"
.Fc
.Pp
.Fn XSyncListSystemCounters
returns a pointer to an array
of system counters supported by the display and sets *n_counters_return
to the number of counters in the array.
The array should be freed with
.Fn XSyncFreeSystemCounterList .
If dpy does not support
the SYNC extension, or if there was an error during communication with
the server, or if the server does not support any system counters,
this function returns NULL.
.Pp
XSyncSystemCounter has the following fields:
.Bd -unfilled

The n_conditions is the number of wait conditions in wait_list.
It
returns

extension; otherwise, it returns
.Fn True .
The await is
processed asynchronously by the server; this function always returns
immediately after issuing the request.

The
attribute_mask column specifies the symbol that the caller should OR
into values_mask to indicate that the value for the corresponding
attribute was actually supplied.
Default values are used for all
attributes that do not have their attribute_mask OR’ed into values_mask.
See the protocol description for
.Fn CreateAlarm

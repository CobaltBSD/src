NAME
----

   XSendExtensionEvent - send input extension events to a client

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   Status XSendExtensionEvent( Display *display,
                               XDevice *device,
                               Window destination,
                               Bool propagate,
                               int event_count,
                               XEventClass *event_list,
                               XEvent *event_send);
   
   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device from which the events are to be
          sent.

   destination
          Specifies the window the event is to be sent to. You can
          pass window id, PointerWindow, or InputFocus.

   propagate
          Specifies a Boolean value that is either True or False.

   event_count
          Specifies the count of XEventClasses in event_list.

   event_list
          Specifies the list of event selections to be used.

   event_send
          Specifies a pointer to the event that is to be sent.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XSendExtensionEvent request identifies the destination
   window, determines which clients should receive the specified
   events, and ignores any active grabs. This request requires you
   to pass an event class list. For a discussion of the valid
   event class names, see XOpenDevice(libmansuffix) This
   request uses the w argument to identify the destination window
   as follows:
     * If w is PointerWindow, the destination window is the window
       that contains the pointer.
     * If w is InputFocus and if the focus window contains the
       pointer, the destination window is the window that contains
       the pointer; otherwise, the destination window is the focus
       window.

   To determine which clients should receive the specified events,
   XSendExtensionEvent uses the propagate argument as follows:
     * If event_list is the empty set, the event is sent to the
       client that created the destination window. If that client
       no longer exists, no event is sent.
     * If propagate is False, the event is sent to every client
       selecting on destination any of the event types specified by
       the event_list array.
     * If propagate is True and no clients have selected on
       destination any of the events specified by the event_list
       array, the destination is replaced with the closest ancestor
       of destination for which some client has selected a type
       specified by the event-list array and for which no
       intervening window has that type in
       its do-not-propagate-mask. If no such window exists or if
       the window is an ancestor of the focus window and
       InputFocus was originally specified as the destination, the
       event is not sent to any clients. Otherwise, the event is
       reported to every client selecting on the final destination
       any of the events specified in the event_list array.

   The event in the XEvent structure must be one of the events
   defined by the input extension (or a BadValue error results) so
   that the X server can correctly byte-swap the contents as
   necessary. The contents of the event are otherwise unaltered and
   unchecked by the X server except to force send_event to True in
   the forwarded event and to set the serial number in the event
   correctly.

   XSendExtensionEvent returns zero if the conversion to wire
   protocol format failed and returns nonzero
   otherwise. XSendExtensionEvent can generate BadClass, BadDevice,
   BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
          specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.

   BadValue
          Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
          accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
          specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
          argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
          set of alternatives can generate this error.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          window.

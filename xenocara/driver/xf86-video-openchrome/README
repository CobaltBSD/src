OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 Release Note (March 7th, 2017)
---------------------------------------------------------

OpenChrome DDX is an open source implementation of X.Org Server 
DDX (Device Dependent X) graphics device driver for VIA Technologies 
UniChrome and Chrome9 IGPs. (Integrated Graphics Processor)
OpenChrome DDX handles only 2D and video acceleration.
Please note that OpenChrome does not support VIA Technologies IGPs 
that are related to Trident Microsystems (i.e., Apollo MVP4, PLE133, 
and KLE133) or S3 Graphics (i.e., KM266). Here is the project home 
page for OpenChrome.

OS Support
----------

- X.Org Server Version 1.7 or later
  (It might not work correctly if it is compiled against an older 
   X.Org Server.)
- Linux Version 2.6.32 or later
  (Note: For Linux Version 4.5 or later, you may have to blacklist 
  vesafb. This is a bug that has not been fixed so far.)



What's New for OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6
-----------------------------------------

OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 is an improved version of OpenChrome DDX 
Version 0.5 with a number of improvements made to the code. OpenChrome 
DDX Version 0.6 is written in a way to completely replace Version 
0.2.904 through 0.5.

OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 has added the following new features.

- First official support for CX700, VX700, and VX800 chipsets 
  integrated TMDS transmitter (i.e., DVI support)
- Initial support for Silicon Image SiI 164 TMDS transmitter


OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 has the following improvements.

- Improved FP reinitialization when resuming from standby
  (HP 2133 Mini-Note, FIC CE260 / CE261 based netbooks like 
   Everex CloudBook and Sylvania g netbook)
- Improved automatic detection of display resources
- Improved X Server stability in dual monitor mode
- Automatic active steering of the display controller channel to the 
  correct display output device


OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 fixes the following bugs.

- Fix for the disruption of the VT (Virtual Terminal) screen bug 
  introduced in Version 0.5
- Fix for HP 2133 Mini-Note's PCIe WLAN getting turned off 
  inadvertently bug introduced in Version 0.5



How to Contact OpenChrome Developers
------------------------------------

Please visit these OpenChrome mailing lists.

http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openchrome-users
http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/openchrome-devel

openchrome-users mailing list is meant for non-technical users asking 
questions about how to use OpenChrome, etc. openchrome-devel mailing 
list is for discussing OpenChrome development issues.



Support for Older Versions
--------------------------

The OpenChrome Project practices rolling release update policy for 
OpenChrome DDX. What this means is that the older version of 
OpenChrome DDX will not be supported once a new version is out. 
It is sometimes useful to try out the older version, in order to see 
if a regression has occurred, but generally speaking, there will be 
no fixes for the older versions. OpenChrome DDX is written so that it 
can be compiled against X.Org Server Version 1.7 or later and Linux 
Version 2.6.32 or later. We will likely maintain this minimum platform 
requirement for the foreseeable future. What this means is that if the 
user wanted to try the latest OpenChrome DDX, it can do so with an OS 
that was released around Year 2010. OpenChrome DDX might still compile 
for anything older than that, but it might not be stable enough to be 
useful.



Where to File a Bug Report
--------------------------

In order to file a bug report, please visit http://bugs.freedesktop.org. 
When you file the bug, file it against "xorg." When specifying the 
component, please select "Driver/openchrome." This allows a message to 
be sent to openchrome-devel mailing list, so that developers can be 
notified of the bug.
    It is highly recommended to file the bug report over at 
http://bugs.freedesktop.org rather than sending a message to 
openchrome-devel mailing list. Also, filing a bug report against the 
Linux / BSD distribution you are using (i.e., Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, 
etc.) will likely be a waste of your time since the developers for those 
distributions do not directly work on developing OpenChrome.



Where to Submit a Patch
-----------------------

In order to submit a patch to improve OpenChrome, please visit 
http://bugs.freedesktop.org. Open a bug report and upload the patch there.
When you file the bug, file it against "xorg." When specifying the 
component, please select "Driver/openchrome." This allows a message to 
be sent to openchrome-devel mailing list, so that developers can be 
notified of the bug.



Where to Obtain OpenChrome Source Code
--------------------------------------

OpenChrome source code repository is located at.

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/openchrome/xf86-video-openchrome/


OpenChrome DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) module source code 
repository is located at.

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/openchrome/drm-openchrome/
https://cgit.freedesktop.org/openchrome/drm-openchrome/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/via



If You See a Bug
----------------

If you see a bug, please don't be surprised. OpenChrome has been in 
development for more than 10 years. In that process, there were many 
different developers that wrote the code in varying ways. OpenChrome 
is a unified graphics device driver that supports 12 generations of 
VIA Technologies IGP starting from CLE266 chipset all the way to 
VX900 chipset. Even the VIA Technologies in house unified graphics 
device driver does not support the number of devices OpenChrome does. 
Furthermore, VIA Technologies IGPs tend to rely heavily on many 
different external encoders and transmitters to display the image. 
As a result, it is very difficult to get the code right for every 
possible configuration you can think of.
    Starting with OpenChrome Version 0.4, the project is under new 
management, and moving forward, the emphasis will be on device driver 
reliability and code maintainability.

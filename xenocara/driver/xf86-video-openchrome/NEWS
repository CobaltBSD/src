OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 (March 7th, 2017)
--------------------------------------------

OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 is an improved version of OpenChrome DDX 
Version 0.5 with a number of improvements made to the code. OpenChrome 
DDX Version 0.6 is written in a way to completely replace Version 
0.2.904 through 0.5.

OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 has added the following new features.

- First official support for CX700, VX700, and VX800 chipsets 
  integrated TMDS transmitter (i.e., DVI support)
- Initial support for Silicon Image SiI 164 TMDS transmitter


OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 has the following improvements.

- Improved FP reinitialization when resuming from standby
  (HP 2133 Mini-Note, FIC CE260 / CE261 based netbooks like 
   Everex CloudBook and Sylvania g netbook)
- Improved automatic detection of display resources
- Improved X Server stability in dual monitor mode
- Automatic active steering of the display controller channel to the 
  correct display output device


OpenChrome DDX Version 0.6 fixes the following bugs.

- Fix for the disruption of the VT (Virtual Terminal) screen bug 
  introduced in Version 0.5
- Fix for HP 2133 Mini-Note's PCIe WLAN getting turned off 
  inadvertently bug introduced in Version 0.5


OpenChrome Version 0.5 (July 6th, 2016)
---------------------------------------

Based on OpenChrome Version 0.4.0 code, OpenChrome Version 0.5 fixes 
several bugs while adding two new features. 

- Major code cleanup
- Removal of more manual options (BusWidth, ForcePanel, and AccelMethod)
- Fix for runtime screen resolution change X.Org Server crash bug
- Fix for CLE266 chipset not being able to function correctly if 
  "CRT + TV" option was chosen in BIOS setup
- Initial support for VIA Technologies VT1632A TMDS transmitter for DVI
- Initial support for multiple display output (i.e., RandR)


OpenChrome Version 0.4.0 (March 31st, 2016)
-------------------------------------------

OpenChrome Version 0.4.0 is a major break from the past versions where 
configuring the display resources were done manually. Now the displays 
are detected mostly automatically, although a few manual options still 
remain. These will be retired in the near future. Besides that, two 
alternative mode setting options were discontinued (VBE mode setting 
and "legacy" mode setting), in order to simplify the code. A regression 
affecting those with a DVI to VGA adapter, which appeared in OpenChrome 
Version 0.3.x, is now fixed. More importantly, devices that were not 
registered with a known device table (a large table that is located 
internally inside the code) used to crash during boot time, but since 
this table was removed completely, this bug does not appear anymore.

- Removal of VBE (VESA BIOS Extension) mode setting
  (removal of VBEModes and VbeSaveRestore options)
- Removal of "legacy" mode setting
  (removal of ModeSwitchMethod option)
- Removal of ActiveDevice option
- Removal of ForcePanel option
- Removal of PanelSize option
- Removal of a known device table internally
- Mostly automatic display detection
- Fix for a regression affecting those with DVI to VGA adapter
- Fix for a boot time crash for devices that were not on the known 
  device table
- Fix for a possible OLPC XO-1.5 detection issue (untested)
- Fix for various small compilation warnings / errors

-----------------------------

The 0.3.0 release is a major step forward for the openchrome X.org
driver. It brings most of the features that are needed with todays X
server. The code has seen a major overhaul, with a lot of new features
and a lot of cleanup. It has been tested on most of the available VIA
IGPs and we believe there are no regression at this point. However, the
testing was done on a limited range of hardware, so your mileage may
vary. Please let us know if you have any trouble using it.

* New Features :
- TTM/GEM support.
- KMS support.
- Better RandR support.
- XAA removal.
- DGA removal.
- Support for X server 1.13 API.
- Code cleanup and bug fixes.

* Known bugs and limitations :

Starting with the 0.3.0 release, please submit bugs and patches to
freedesktop.org bug tracker.

openchrome 0.2.902 (08/04/2008)
-------------------------------
* Enhancements and bug fixes:
- libpciaccess support.
- Fix Xv on LCD for VM800/CN700/P4M800pro.
- Fix P4M900 fifo setting.
- Various code clean up.

* New boards:

  (aka Everex Cloudbook CE1200V), VIA Epia SN.

* Notes:
- The "HWCursor" option has been removed. Hardware-accelerated cursor is on by
  default, so this option was useless. Use the "SWCursor" option if you want to
  disable HW cursor.
- AGPDMA has been disabled for K8M800 and VM800/CN700/P4M800pro in this release
  because it causes screen repaint and lockup issues. The problem has been
  tracked down to a bug in kernel drm. All kernel >= 2.6.22 are affected. This
  bug will be fixed in the upcoming 2.6.25-rc7. It is also fixed in current
  drm git tree. If you're using one of the affected kernels, you'll have to
  either keep AGPDMA disabled  or build the modules from the fixed drm git
  tree. This option brings extra performance for some operations. To use it,
  add 'Option "EnableAGPDMA"' in the Device section of the xorg configuration.
